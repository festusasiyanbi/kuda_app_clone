# Kuda App Clone

## Overview
This project is a React Native clone of the home page of the Kuda Finance app. It replicates the user interface and design elements of the original app's home screen.

## Features
- Quick Access: I worked on the quick access sectio of the app which allow users have access to common features like Airtime, Internet, TV, and Electricity payments with just a tap
- Stylish Icons: I downloaded some png files from [Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/) and used in place of react-native-vector-icons
